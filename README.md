# 🅿️ Smart Parking Detection System

This project is a **simple smart parking system** that uses an **ESP32-CAM** to capture images of a parking lot and a **Python script (with OpenCV)** to detect which spots are occupied.

It works by comparing the current image to a reference image (with all spots empty) and detecting pixel differences to determine if a car is present.

⚠️ **Project still under development** – improvements and optimizations are ongoing.
